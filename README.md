# FarmX-Farmer-Assistance

## The Problem

In India, agriculture is the main occupation. The majority of the population is engaged in agriculture. One of the major problems faced by farmers is the lack of adequate information on the current scenario of crops in the country. Due to the unavailability of such information, many farmers are facing huge losses by planting crops that have a very less demand currently or by not planting the crops that are in high demand. Another major problem is the sudden occurrence of a drought or a flood.

## The Solution

FarmX is an idea that helps farmers to ease their daily tasks and provides them with a snapshot of the current scenario of farming in the country.

From each farmer in the country, we collect different types of information such as :
The Crop they plan on harvesting for the season.
The amount of land they own.
The amount of land they plan on cultivating.
The amount of yield they are expecting for the season.
We then construct a database based on this information includes the tasks farmers are currently performing in the country. Many useful implications can be drawn from this kind of data, some of which are :
We can identify the net total of crops and their yields.
Based on this data we can plan on the import/export of food grains well in advance
Based on the previous statistics of food consumption in the country we can see whether the expected yield is adequate for the country’s current requirement or not.
We can also use this data to guide farmers on the demand and supply ratio of each food-crop for the current season.

Additionally, farmers can report the hindrances they’re facing through the application which aids the government in delivering better solutions to issues faced by them. 

Through the app, farmers can update already filled details if they face any issues such as droughts or floods, this helps the government in aiding them in such kind of situations.
